    I'll Be Quite Blunt. I'm a Computer Science Major and Definitely Am Up to the Task When It Comes to Handling All of the School-Work So Far. However, I Have Not Acquired the Necessary Skills Just Yet to Be Fully Ready Outside of School... And That's Fine. I'm Not Really "Supposed to" Yet. At This Point, I Only Have Experience with Java and Have Dabbled a Bit into the Waters of C(family), Python, and Now HTML in This Class. I Can Not Produce Content In Those Languages Though, Rather Just Understand Them. What I Do Have Is What I'd Consider A Fair Understanding of Concepts, Which Makes It Quite Easy To Pickup New Languages On the Fly & Interpret Them At The Very Least
