Work Experience
</h3>

    <para>
As I Touched on Earlier, I Am a Content Creator Primarily on Youtube in Twitch. I Do This Full-Time, Year-Round. as Such, I Have Not Had Any Experience Outside of This and School in Terms of Work. What I Can Say Is
That I Am Soon Beginning Development on My First Custom Zombies Experience, Which Would Be a Great Thing Not Only for the Zombies Community, but to Showcase to a Future Employer. That's a major project that will Take
months. More Soon, I Will Be Starting Development On A Casino Style Mobile Game.
