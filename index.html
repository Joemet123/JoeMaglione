About Myself & Education
</h3>

    <para>
      Hi, My Name Is Joe Maglione & I'm Currently A Senior Here At St. John's Majoring In Computer Science. As For My Future, I Have MANY Personal Goals That I Don't Wish To Share Publicly. It Usually Does Nothing But Diminish Their True Value. However, I
  Will Say That I Intend To Use The Knowledge I've Gained At St. John's To Some Capacity At Some Point In The Future On Top Of Various Other Things That I Believe I'm Capable Of. Two Fun Facts About Myself Are That I Led All The NY PSAL AA In Batting
  Average In 2019 As A Senior Varsity Baseball Player. Also, I Do Youtube & Twitch As A Job. Click My Logo At The Top To Be Taken to My YouTube Channel

  General Interests & Content Consumption
</h3>

      <para>
       I'm a Very Simple Person. I Love Call of Duty Zombies. I Create Content (Both Stream and Upload Videos) on Call of Duty Zombies. Other Than That, I Watch and Play a Lot of Baseball and Go to the Gym to Work Out for Baseball. I Love Baseball & Content Creation. That's It Lol! I Don't Really Watch Movies or TV Shows Either. But If I Was Forced to Pick, Prison Break Would Definitely be The Show I Say Is My Favorite. If Anything, I'll Usually Just Watch Youtube or Twitch Though. The Sidemen YT Channel Is My Favorite by Far. Like I Said, I'm Pretty Simple. By The Way, Here Are The Links To Some of My Most Used Sites:
