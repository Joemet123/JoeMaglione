  About Myself & Education
  </h3>

      <para>
        Hi, My Name Is Joe Maglione & I'm Currently A Senior Here At St. John's Majoring In Computer Science. As For My Future, I Have MANY Personal Goals That I Don't Wish To Share Publicly. It Usually Does Nothing But Diminish Their True Value. However, I
    Will Say That I Intend To Use The Knowledge I've Gained At St. John's To Some Capacity At Some Point In The Future On Top Of Various Other Things That I Believe I'm Capable Of. Two Fun Facts About Myself Are That I Led All The NY PSAL AA In Batting
    Average In 2019 As A Senior Varsity Baseball Player. Also, I Do Youtube & Twitch As A Job. Click My Logo At The Top To Be Taken to My YouTube Channel

  General Interests & Content Consumption
</h3>

      <para>
       I'm a Very Simple Person. I Love Call of Duty Zombies. I Create Content (Both Stream and Upload Videos) on Call of Duty Zombies. Other Than That, I Watch and Play a Lot of Baseball and Go to the Gym to Work Out for Baseball. I Love Baseball & Content Creation. That's It Lol! I Don't Really Watch Movies or TV Shows Either. But If I Was Forced to Pick, Prison Break Would Definitely be The Show I Say Is My Favorite. If Anything, I'll Usually Just Watch Youtube or Twitch Though. The Sidemen YT Channel Is My Favorite by Far. Like I Said, I'm Pretty Simple. By The Way, Here Are The Links To Some of My Most Used Sites:

            <para>
        As I Touched on Earlier, I Am a Content Creator Primarily on Youtube in Twitch. I Do This Full-Time, Year-Round. as Such, I Have Not Had Any Experience Outside of This and School in Terms of Work. What I Can Say Is
        That I Am Soon Beginning Development on My First Custom Zombies Experience, Which Would Be a Great Thing Not Only for the Zombies Community, but to Showcase to a Future Employer. That's a major project that will Take
        months. More Soon, I Will Be Starting Development On A Casino Style Mobile Game.

                <para>
              I'll Be Quite Blunt. I'm a Computer Science Major and Definitely Am Up to the Task When It Comes to Handling All of the School-Work So Far. However, I Have Not Acquired the Necessary Skills Just Yet to Be Fully Ready Outside of School... And That's Fine. I'm Not Really "Supposed to" Yet. At This Point, I Only Have Experience with Java and Have Dabbled a Bit into the Waters of C(family), Python, and Now HTML in This Class. I Can Not Produce Content In Those Languages Though, Rather Just Understand Them. What I Do Have Is What I'd Consider A Fair Understanding of Concepts, Which Makes It Quite Easy To Pickup New Languages On the Fly & Interpret Them At The Very Least
